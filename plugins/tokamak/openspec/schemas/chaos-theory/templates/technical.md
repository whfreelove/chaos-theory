## Context

<!-- Background, current state, tech stack relevant to changes. Reference existing decisions if applicable. -->

## Objectives

<!-- Specific, measurable outcomes. Format: `OBJ-<slug>`: <outcome statement> -->

## Architecture

### System Overview

<!-- Mermaid diagram showing system-level changes. Diff vs openspec/project.md if populated; full diagram if empty. -->

### Component Interactions

<!-- Mermaid sequence/flowchart showing how components communicate. Focus on changed interactions. -->

## Components

<!-- For each new/modified component:

`CMP-<slug>`: <component-name>
- **Description**: <what it is>
- **Responsibilities**: <what it does>
- **Dependencies**: <what it uses>
-->

## Interfaces

<!-- OPTIONAL. Component contracts for cross-component communication.
Format: `INT-<slug>`: <operation name>
Include inputs, outputs, error responses, and data shapes inline.
Skip for internal-only components. -->

## Decisions

<!-- Y-statements ONLY. Each decision is a single structured sentence.
Decisions must be approved before being written here.
Delete superseded decisions immediately. -->

## Risks

<!-- OPTIONAL. Cross-cutting risks not tied to specific decisions.
Decision-specific trade-offs belong in Y-statement "accepting" clause, not here.
Format: [Risk] → [Mitigation] -->
